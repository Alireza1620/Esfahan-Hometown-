					<h4>History</h4>
					<p>The fact that biryan is the only special food of Isfahan, where it is prepared and sold separately and is not usually cooked with other foods, brings its importance to the people of Isfahan. Of course, only authentic Isfahani people know that the name of this dish is biryan, and the rest call it biryani by mistake. The word Biryani is a relative adjective in grammar, and in Isfahan it refers to a place and a shop to cook and sell biryan; And the suffix "Yai" is attached to the adjective instead of the noun; Therefore, the name of the food itself is Briyan, not Biryani. A grammar-literary event has also happened in this word and it is (alm balgalbah) or general and special permission. In all parts of the world, various types of food have been called "briyan" and of course, most of them used it in a compound form, such as "briyan". Rice, roast goose, roast chicken, these combinations can be found in ancient Iranian cooking treatises. Even now, in many parts of the world, dishes called "biriyani" are cooked, which are completely different from what is called biriyani in Isfahan, such as Indian biryani, Burmese biryani, Bangladeshi biryani, Sri Lankan biryani, Iraqi biryani, and Sindhi biryani.</p>
					<p>In ancient Persian literature, there are many evidences of the word "biriyani" which is used either as an adjective for another food or as a special name of an old food, meaning cooked meat with rice and other side dishes.<br>
						What emerges from the evidence of literary and historical texts is that Isfahan's biryan is not included in any of the above titles and is a special food that cannot be more than four hundred years old, so not those who wrote that the history of biryan goes back to the time of Zoroaster They have proof of it, and not those who do not consider it to be more than 180 years before the end of the Qajar rule, have information about Bayran from Safavid texts.</p>
					<p>Briyan, which is well-known by Isfahans and tourists today, is a delicious and fatty lunch food made from pure sheep meat. Today, meat with bones is first boiled in water with onion, salt and a little spice such as turmeric (semi-cooked), then it is separated from the bone and minced with its own fat, and then in small quantities with cinnamon and dry mint, in spatulas. They roast a little on a wide copper plate under a special copper tray that is placed on a gas oven, and then, together with walnuts or almond slices, they are spread on a bread greased with water, the minced cooked meat that is the decoration of the food and is known as Shosh and Donbeh , they consume A very delicious and hearty combination. Bread is more pleasant if it is stone or homemade.</p>
					<p>Anyway, it is considered a heavy and greasy food, especially since some tallit broth and curd are added with buttermilk, basil and onion. All these are very popular in Isfahan. But when we know that its cooking quality was very different in the not-so-distant past, and also that the phenomenon of frying - which degrades its nutritional value - did not occur in it, this transformation, which, like many phenomena in life, is accelerated and regressive. Today, it is a caricature of its traditional form, we regret it.</p>
